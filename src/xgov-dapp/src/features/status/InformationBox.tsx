          <strong>Your xGov duty is to vote in all voting sessions during the 12 months of the Term Pool duration.</strong> That maintains
          your eligibility to receive the Algo deposit (your original governance rewards) back at the end of the term pool.{' '}

          more than one Term Pool simultaneously, and miss a voting session, the total of Algos across all pools will be forfeited.

          At the end of the Term Pool, the Algos forfeited by the ineligible xGovs will be distributed amongst all eligible xGovs.

        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Your xGov deposit is equal to the governance rewards of the period you opted in to xGov. It is displayed in ÂµA (or microAlgo)
          because smart contracts cannot handle decimal numbers. Your xGov deposit plus your Term Pool forfeited Algo share will be your
          payout in 12 months, if you remain eligible.
