          <strong>Your xGov duty is to vote in all voting sessions during the 12 months of the Term Pool duration.</strong> That maintains
          your eligibility to receive the Algo deposit (your original governance rewards) back at the end of the term pool.{' '}

          more than one Term Pool simultaneously, and miss a voting session, the total of Algos across all pools will be forfeited.

          At the end of the Term Pool, the Algos forfeited by the ineligible xGovs will be distributed amongst all eligible xGovs.

        <Typography>
          Your xGov Current Balance is equal to the sum of the Governance Rewards of the periods you opted in to xGov plus your Term Pool
          forfeited Algo share. It is displayed in ÂµA (or microAlgo) because smart contracts cannot handle decimal numbers. You will receive
          your Deposit, plus the forfeited Algo share, after 12 months from the commitment.
